# about-me:
#     title: About Me
#     summary: |
#       Hello! I'm Jacob, a passionate software engineer with over 7 years of experience in building robust and innovative solutions. My journey in software engineering stems from a lifelong passion, beginning back in 4th grade when I first started learning HTML and related frameworks. This early interest only deepened through high school, where I added PHP/MySQL to my skillset. Later, in a support role, I picked up Python and was eventually invited to join the engineering team after demonstrating an excellent understanding of software engineering in a highly specialized support position.
#       Outside of my professional life, I have a few passions that keep me grounded and inspired. I'm an avid gardener, finding joy in nurturing plants and watching them grow, which offers a refreshing contrast to the digital world I work in. Baking is another hobby I cherish; there's something immensely satisfying about creating something delicious from scratch.
#       Family is a cornerstone of my life. I'm a proud parent to three wonderful children: two daughters, aged 13 and 11, and a son who is 7. Balancing work with family time is incredibly important to me, and I always make sure to be present for all the little moments that matter.
#       I'm also a keyboard enthusiast, which might sound a bit niche, but for me, it's about optimizing my workspace and maximizing efficiency. I prefer the Workman layout for its ergonomic benefits, and I've customized my keyboard firmware extensively to better suit my workflows and enhance my productivity.
#       Thank you for visiting my site. I hope my passion for technology, creativity, and continuous improvement resonates with you. Feel free to explore more about my work and reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
